# Classifier

Our final classifier can be found in ngram_classifier.py

# Trials
* Code for generating the bigram_results/*.csv can be found in bigram_trail.py
* Code for generating the trigram_results/*.csv can be found in trigram_trail.py
* Code for generating the ngram_results/*.csv can be found in ngram_trail.py

The code for these files is fairly repetative since we wanted to archive the bi/tri code in addition to the final ngram_trial code.

# Analysis
* Code for generating graphs from bigram_results/*.csv can be found as an Juypter notebook at bigram_analysis.ipynb
* Code for generating graphs from trigram_results/*.csv can be found as an Juypter notebook at trigram_analysis.ipynb
* Code for generating graphs from triigram_results/*.csv can be found as an Juypter notebook at ngram_analysis.ipynb

The code for these files is fairly repetative since we wanted to archive the bi/tri code in addition to the final ngram_analysis code.
